THANKS                                                        *hlmarks-thanks*

This plug-in is based on the idea of plug-in ShowMarks(Anthony Kruize), and
I had a hint of implementation from the forked version by exvim and bootleq.
I thank them to take this opportunity.

In addition, I made ASCII Text of title by 'ASCII.gellery'
(http://ascii.gallery/figlet) with using style 'slant'.
Thank for a great service!

INTRODUCTION                                            *hlmarks-introduction*

*hlmarks* is a Vim plug-in to highlight the mark, to display the mark name in
the left side of the screen(hereinafter called 'gutter'). 
In addition, it provides the following functions.

    - Toggle a mark on the same line.                       (|hlmarks-toggle|)
    - Considers vertical order of signs including by the other plug-in on the 
      gutter in the same line.
    - Incremental marking.                                (|hlmarks-automark|)
    - Remove marks on the current line.              (|hlmarks-rm-marks-line|)
    - Remove marks on the current buffer.          (|hlmarks-rm-marks-buffer|)
    - Refresh highlights and mark names.                   (|hlmarks-refresh|)

It should be noted that this plug-in is not to control the |mark| function
itself.
In other words, even if you set how this plug-in, you do not have any impact 
on the operation of the |mark| function.

==============================================================================
LIMITATION                                                *hlmarks-limitation*

- Poor and bad English. 8-(
- Automatic update of highlight and mark name is done in the 4000ms interval,
  only when there is no input from the user in the normal mode.
  This is because the automatic execution of periodic processes is performed
  in a pseudo approach, there is a possibility that unexpected behavior occurs
  other than the normal mode.(I am praying sincerely that the official polling
  functionality is implemented in Vim 8-))
  Other than the normal mode, assuming that there is less likely to change the
  mark or display in the gutter by others(plug-ins, etc), so I look at the 
  situation in this specification at present.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                            *hlmarks-installation*

This plug-in is developed against Vim 7.4.
Since this plug-in uses some of the features that have been introduced from
7.4, it works only in 7.4 or later.

This plug-in follows the standard runtime path structure, so you can install
with a variety of plug-in managers such as Pathogen, Vundle, NeoBundle, or
directly install from Github, Zip archive, as you like.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                          *hlmarks-usage*

This plug-in highlights the line and displays corresponding mark name to the
gutter when the mark is placed by |m|(a-zA-Z) |m'| |m`| |m[| |m]| |m<| |m>|.

ex: put the mark 'a' >

    ma
<
Now, the line put the mark is highlighted, and you will see the mark name 'a>'
in the gutter.

Highlight and display the name for all marks that are set to
|hlmarks_displaying_marks|. Thus, marks other than described above, that can
not be put in manually, will be updated and displayed after a certain interval
(currently after 4000ms) by set to this option.

Please refer to |hlmarks-options| for a change of color definition of the
highlights and format of mark name.

                                                              *hlmarks-toggle*
In addition, when you put the mark described above on the line that put the
same mark again, that mark is deleted, and it will also remove highlight and
mark name on the gutter at the same time.
However, marks by |m'| and |m`| can not be removed, this feature doesn't work.

For other features, please refer to |hlmarks-mappings| and |hlmarks-commands|.
